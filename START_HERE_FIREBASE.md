## 🚨 Common Questions

### Q: Is my Cloudflare version gone?
**A:** No! It's safely backed up at:
```
/home/user/webapp-cloudflare-backup-20251017.tar.gz
```

### Q: Will this cost money?
**A:** Firebase has a generous free tier. Expected costs:
- Small usage: **$0-5/month** (within free tier)
- Medium usage: **$5-15/month**
- Large usage: **$15-40/month**

Set up budget alerts to avoid surprises!

### Q: Do I need to change my frontend code?
**A:** No! All API endpoints are the same. Your frontend works without any changes.

### Q: What if something goes wrong?
**A:** You can always restore from the backup. Plus, we have comprehensive troubleshooting guides in the documentation.

### Q: Is Firebase better than Cloudflare?
**A:** Different use cases:
- **Cloudflare**: Great for ultra-low-cost, simple apps
- **Firebase**: Better for growing apps, complex data, team collaboration

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Budget Alerts**: Set up budget alerts in Firebase Console ($25/month recommended)
2. **Start Small**: Deploy first, customize later
3. **Test Locally**: Use Firebase emulators before deploying (`firebase emulators:start`)
4. **Backup Data**: Set up automated Firestore exports once live
5. **Monitor Logs**: Check Firebase Console regularly for errors
